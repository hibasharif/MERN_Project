Perfect 👌 Thanks for sharing your project zip. Since this is a **MERN project with Docker deployment**, I’ll create a good **README.md** file for you that explains everything clearly.

Here’s a draft you can use directly in your repo:

---

# MERN Product Management App

This is a **MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** project that allows users to **add, edit, delete, and manage a list of products**. The project is also **Dockerized** for easy deployment.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Edit existing products
* Delete products
* View product list in real-time
* Full-stack app (MongoDB + Express + React + Node)
* Docker support for containerized deployment

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

Would you like me to also **auto-generate badges** (for Docker, Node, React, MongoDB) at the top of your README so it looks more professional like open-source projects?
